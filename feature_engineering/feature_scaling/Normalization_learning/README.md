Learning With Normalization.(Machine Learning)


Normalization is a technique often applied as part of data preparation for machine learning. 
The goal of normalization is to changes the values of numeric columns in the dataset to use a common scale, 
without distorting in the range of values or losing information.



Type of Normalization:-

1. MinMaxScaling
2. Mean Normalization
3. Max Absulate
4. Robust Scaling
