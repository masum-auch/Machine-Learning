Feature Engineering

This folder contains notebooks and scripts dedicated to **feature engineering**,
a crucial step for improving model performance and data quality. The following topics are covered:



  1. Feature Transformation
      Transform existing features into more meaningful representations to enhance predictive power.

  2. Feature Construction
      Create new features from existing data to capture additional insights and relationships.

  3. Feature Selection
      Identify and select the most relevant features using statistical tests or model-based approaches.

  4. Feature Extraction
      Extract key features from raw data using techniques such as **PCA**, embeddings, or dimensionality reduction methods.

  5. Missing Value Imputation
      Handle missing or incomplete data using strategies like **mean/median/mode imputation** or advanced predictive methods.

  6. Handling Categorical Features
      Encode categorical variables effectively using **one-hot encoding, label encoding, target encoding**, or other methods.

  7. Outlier Detection
      Detect and manage outliers to maintain data integrity and improve model robustness.

  8. Feature Scaling
      Scale numerical features using **standardization**, **normalization**, or other techniques to make data suitable for machine learning algorithms.
